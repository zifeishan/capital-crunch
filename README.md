# Capital Crunch: Predicting Investments in Tech Companies

For many start-ups, lack of investment and capital has become the
bottleneck for development. This phenomenon inspires us to use machine
learning algorithms to find patterns in investment behavior from major
investors. We plan to use various domain-specific features to predict
which investors would potentially invest in a particular company .
This would not only reveal important information about investment
strategies and behaviors of investors, but also give startups ideas on
where to seek potential investment and how to adjust their strategies
so as to attract potential investors.

Our work is grounded in CrunchBase, an accessible knowledge base that
maintains full records of company and people information.

There are two primary goals of our work:

- To predict whether an investor would invest in a particular start-up based on textual, topological and domain-specific signals from both the investor and start-up.
- To analyze and reveal the factors that would prompt an investor to invest in startups so as to shed light on the adjustments the start-ups could make to attract more investments.
